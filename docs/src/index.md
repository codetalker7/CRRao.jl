# CRRao

CRRao is a package that implements statistical models. The implementation 
of statistical models becomes straightforward for most Julia users 
with the help of this package. This is going to be a wrapper package;
leveraging the strength of wonderful Julia packages that already exist, 
such as StatsBase, StatsModels, Distributions, GLM, Turing, DataFrames,
LinearAlgebra etc.

CRRao is a consistent framework through which callers interact with 
a large suite of models. For the end-user, it reduces the cost and complexity 
of estimating/training statistical models. It offers convenient guidelines through 
which development of additional statistical models can take place in the future.

We follow a framework which makes contribution to this package easy.
